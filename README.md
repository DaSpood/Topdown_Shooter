# Topdown_Shooter

## About

### What is this

This project is a base for a topdown shooter game, made with Unity.

The game in question does not currently have a name and will likely stay this way to encourage people to use this base.

It is heavily inspired by the Boxhead series, developped by [Sean Cooper][sean-cooper].

### Why does this exist

Here are the four reasons why I decided to create this project:
- To practice C# programming, Git, [Gitflow][gitflow], and other things that are good to practice as a developper
- To have a go at game development with the Unity game engine
- To adapt/recreate a cool flash game that I had fun playing when I was younger
- To create a base project that others can use to learn from or build upon for their own project

## Development

### Dependencies

The project is made using Unity 2019.4.4f1 Personal.

### Roadmap

A [roadmap][roadmap] of planned updates and their feature is available.
This roadmap was made for organising and scoping the project, and may not be followed perfectly, but it should give a rough idea of what features are planned and when they should appear.

Note that the roadmap only goes as far as a first 'alpha' release.

At that point, the project will contain enough core features to be considered a 'playable' game (as in: a beggining, a gameplay loop, and a game over condition).
All the core systems should be implemented and adding new variants (new weapons or characters for example) should be easy for anyone using it as a base.
The project will however still not contain any original art like player models or textures.

After that point, ***I may choose to continue development in closed-source*** in order to finish a game that I can call my own and maybe distribute, add original features or game mechanics that may not fit the original design, and better protect art assets that will be added.
It is too early to decide wether or not the project will stay open-source past its first alpha release, but keep in mind this is a possibility.

## Contribute

At the moment, there is no plan to collaborate on the code, so there is very little chance that pull requests will be accepted.
That being said, and as mentionned previously, one of the main goals of this project is to learn and practice.
So feel free to ask questions, give suggestions, criticize elements of the project, point out bugs, etc.
All of it will be read, answered as soon as possible, and taken into account to fix or improve the project.
